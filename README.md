# BaselineDRL Implementations

Simple implementations of common DRL algorithms for use in engineering applications.

## Structure

The `IndependantAlgs` folder contains files with working examples of each algorithm.

The `Components` folder breaks the learning up into the components of:
- Replay buffer
- Training loop
- Network
- Learning algorithm

This separation allows for certain components to be easily compared and evaluated.

The `Testing` folder contains example experiments of the algorithms comparing their performance on the Gym control tasks.
